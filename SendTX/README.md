This sketch is for testing, see how it works and have some use from it.
This is sending node, it will transmit 3 values.

1: Packer count (on receiver you can then check if any packet was lost)
2: Ack RSSI (RSSI that comes back to sender as sender requests ACK, this way you have an idea how strong is the signal coming back)
3: Current power level of sender (0-31)

This will allow you to change all different setting and see how they affect those 3 values
